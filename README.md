_ **Abstract-The project is based on microcontroller in the target of building a smart garbage system that opens up the cover itself whenever a user is before the system within its Range. Arduino UNO R3 board, servo motor and sonar sensor is used to construct the system. The target of this project is to ensure a system of dirt collection through technology and maintaining a clean and healthy environment in offices, schools, restaurants and home. to be used for throwing garbage while the system lights up.** _

1. **Introduction:**

The process includes the circuit connection to be ensured properly. All the instrument must be working efficiently and the code needs to be uploaded in the Arduino IDE. After the code being successfully uploaded in the IDE, the system must be checked whether it works or not. The code should not be contradicted to the connection made to produce the hardware. However, the vision is to make the smart garbage system to work successfully without any disturbance or Intervention to ease the human life. As technology is developed in the sense of meeting the daily activities with comfort. That is what this developed system will do.

1. **Background studies** : A sensor is a physical phenomenon that converts the light, sound, hit signals to the device to digital signal. If this sensor is used in garbage system that may detect the presence of user in front of it and then the cover may open up [2]. If the LED light is on when the cover is down, it will be easy for the user to detect the place of the garbage system in the dark. The code functionality can be done in Arduino IDE and the system wiring is done through the Arduino UNO board. That is how the system can be implemented.

1. **Methodology:**

The project hardware is basically focused on a small 1 feet bucket. The bucket has holes all around its body. The ultrasonic sensor is placed in the bucket to the outside environment for sensing. The servo motor is actually used to produce the mechanical power to open up the cover just when the sensor detects the presence of a user. The motor is tied with thin threads which pulls the cover of the bucket to open up during this process. Then after 2 seconds the cover is down on the bucket as it was.

LED light is connected with the Arduino board and the sensor. So that, it can light up when it is needed.

The picture of the system is given below:

The connecting wires are used to make connection between Arduino UNO board, sensor and the servo motor , the three major components of the project. In the connection part the pin configuration is briefly demonstrated and showed. The cover of the bucket is cut from a plastic board and made a circular shape to fit over the bucket. The 9 volt battery is connected with the Arduino pin. The battery is technically placed inside of the bucket but, it can also be placed outside. This is the vital component which powers up the heart of the system, the Arduino UNO.

**4. Project equipment list** :

**servo motor:** The mechanical power motor used to pull the plastic cover. It works by codded and generated signals.

There is an output shaft that can swing from Its place.

**Ultra- sonic sensor:** The device is HC-S04 model. It is actually a sonar sensor.

**Arduino UNO R3** : The microcontroller model that is the most updated version available. Used to combine between hardware and software. It has 20 digital I/O pins. Can be connected with a computer port.

**bucket** :To contain the garbage.

**board / cover** : Plastic made board to cover the bucket.

**connecting wires** : Male to male and male to female jumpers to connect among the pins of Arduino , motor and sensor.

**battery** : A 9 volt battery for power supply to power up Arduino.

**Threads** : Thin threads to pull up the plastic cover
